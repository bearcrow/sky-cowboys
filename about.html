  <h1>About Sky Cowboys</h1>
  <span class = "p-heading"> Chasms cut across the landscape, forming a mosaic of &quot;islands&quot;.</span>
  <p>The land islands and chasms alike range from a scant few hundred feet across to hundreds of miles wide. The chasms were formed by a cataclysmic event that devastated civilization. Many animal species evolved to handle the new world while humanity struggled to recover. Most notably - the horse gained wings and became the pegasus. Mankind eventually tamed the pegasus and finally started to flourish. The Current Era is a wild west. Steam, coal, iron, and steel are the basis for technology and government is highly regional with sheriffs and rangers covering their local area with great swaths of free range space between towns.</p>

  <span class="p-heading">Those who fly pegasi are called Pilots.</span>
  <p>Pilots are known by their traditional blue scarf and can hold a variety of jobs, from herding other flying creatures to carrying goods/messages across the chasms, or perhaps they are traveling craftsmen. Pilots are the center of trading and information between the islands where bridges cannot reach. The life of a pilot promises adventure, money, and danger to those who have skill and guts. Some choose to deal honestly, while others become bandits.</p>

  <span class="p-heading">Pegasi are used for everything.</span>
  <p>There are three main classes - broadwings, longwings, and shortwings:</p>

  <span class="p-heading">Broadwings</span>
  <p>These pegasi are hardy and highly adaptable. Perfect for all sorts of pilots, whether they’re ranchmen, herders, or traveling tradesmen. Their wings are similar to eagle, hawk, crow, and goose wings. They come in all horse colors and many more plumage colors and types.</p>

  <span class="p-heading">Longwings</span>
  <p>Like their name suggests, longwings have very long wings. Think sea birds like albatross, terns, and gulls. They can stay aloft for days, even weeks, at a time. As such, hops don’t mean anything to pilots who fly longwings. They’re usually called “longhaul” pilots. Longwings are often gray or white in color, but can come in sorrel, bay, and black. It’s rare to find a painted or palomino longwing.</p>

  <span class="p-heading">Shortwings</span>
  <p>These are heavy pegasi - mostly draft horses with small wings akin to songbirds. They are flightless and as such have been isolated to their respective islands. They’ve evolved many different types and colors of plumage. People use them for riding, pulling carts, and field work like plowing.</p>
