          >
          is the story of Molly Shepherd, a studious researcher fresh out of schooling.
          When she receives hard evidence of an elusive creature widely considered a myth,
          she abandons her books and sets out to search for the cryptid for herself...
          but she's going to have to cross the Wild Winds to find it. She’ll need to hold 
          her own in a pilot posse and find her very own pegasus to traverse the dangerous 
          chasms that carve through the landscape. And that’s only the beginning of 
          learning the ropes of life on the trail in this high&dash;flying, wild&dash;adventure.

          Hi, I'm Lauren, also known as &ldquo;BarnLarn&rdquo; online. I'm a
          concept artist and illustrator from the midwest. I've worked in
          animation &amp; the equestrian industry (everything from summer camps to
          dressage show barns). Now I design and make costumes and props in
          Minnesota. Sky Cowboys is my personal project.

          My love of horsemanship and the outdoors started at an early age
          &dash; taking lessons as a little kid, and buying my first horse at 13
          for a couple hundred bucks. I met a fantastic trainer shortly after.
          His methods are a perfect balance of old-school ranch skills, ethical
          handling, and a high degree of technical finesse. It has shaped not
          only how I work with horses, but my personal character and worldview.
          I've soaked up all of his horsemanship knowledge over the years and
          have ridden, hiked, camped, and climbed all over the hills and
          mountains of the west coast, and through the forests and lakeshores of
          Minnesota & Wisconsin.

          I started developing Sky Cowboys back when I lived in Los Angeles
          &dash; inspired by my rides though the wild-west landscape and
          dramatic vistas of Yosemite, while pining for untouched wilderness as
          I lived in a crowded city. I created and self-published an artbook
          full of vibrant concept art, and now Greenhorn Trail is a brand new
          comic taking place in the world of Sky Cowboys.
